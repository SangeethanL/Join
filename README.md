# Join - Task manager

This is a task manager inspired by the kanban system.<br>
Users can create an account or log in as a guest. <br>
<br>
They are able to add tasks with a title, a description, a priority (Urgent, Medium or Low), <br>
set a date for the task to be finished, add contacts to them and also create subtasks. <br>
<br>
Those tasks can be editted and moved on the BOARD of the task manager. <br>
